OOP Concepts short notes

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together 
the data and functions (methods) that manipulate the data, and that keeps both 
safe from outside interference and misuse. 
Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.

Inheritance (OOP) is when an object or class is based on another object or class,

Overloading occurs when two or more methods (or constructors) in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

Overriding occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters. One of the methods is in the parent class, 
and the other is in the child class. 
Overriding allows a child class to provide the specific implementation of a method that is already present in its parent class.â€‹
